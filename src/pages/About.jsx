      I'm a Toronto-based full stack developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional user experiences, and a knack for writing clean, elegant, and efficient code.

      As a former laboratory scientist in microbiology, professional flautist, and with a love for painting and modeling, I've got some pretty nifty, unique skills you might not find elsewhere!

      Obsessed with all things Sci-Fi. Virtual Reality enthusiast. Paints miniature models. Outdoorsy and adventurous. */}
